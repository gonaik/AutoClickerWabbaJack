Requirements:
java 1.8

sikulixapi-2.0.5.jar

You need to have the sikulixapi-2.0.5.jar in same folder as the jar,
or if you want to compile then you need it in the lib folder.

you can get it here:
https://raiman.github.io/SikuliX1/downloads.html

How to use:

1- Run the AutoClickerWabbaJack.jar

2 - Click on Run button (you will get message "Running" if it is working)

That's it, now it will auto click whenever the "Slow Download" is shown on the screen.
